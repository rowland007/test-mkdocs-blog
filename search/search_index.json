It does this outside the official VPN plumbing of Windows. That design has the severe limitation that you need to be an administrator of the machine, but this guide provides a workaround to allow standard users to enable the VPN interface.</p> <p></p> <p>WireGuard\u00ae is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN. However, WireGuard will not run on Windows when the user is a non-administrator account.</p> <p>Unlike other VPN tools and technologies, the Wireguard client creates a tunnel interface (showing up as a network adapter) for each connection you have configured when you try to connect, aka \"on the fly\". When you terminate the connection the client deletes the tunnel interface entirely. It does this outside the official VPN plumbing of Windows.
